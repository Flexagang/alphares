## Notice
* You may also need to set a custom resolution in your Nvidia or AMD Control Panel for alphares to work.
* alphares can set the read-only attribute on the configuration file. It is on by default, however, you will not be allowed to save changes in your Fortnite Settings while it is on. If it is off, Fortnite **may** overwrite your custom settings when you update the game.
* alphares will save your custom settings to `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\FortniteGame\Saved\Config\WindowsClient\GameUserSettings.ini`, and set the read-only attribute after saving the file.
