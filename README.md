## Notice
* You may also need to set a custom resolution in your Nvidia or AMD Control Panel.
* alphares can modify the read-only attribute on the configuration file. It is checked by default, but you will not be allowed to save changes in your Settings. If it is unchecked, Fortnite **may** overwrite your custom resolution when you update the game.
* alphares will save your custom resolution to `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\FortniteGame\Saved\Config\WindowsClient\GameUserSettings.ini`, and modify the read-only attribute after saving the file.
