## Note
* Please ensure you have launched **Fortnite** at least once, and allowed the game to automatically detect the best settings or have saved custom settings in-game before running alphares.
* You need to set a custom resolution in your Nvidia or AMD Control Panel as well as in alphares to use a custom resolution in Fortnite.
* alphares can set/unset the read-only attribute for the Fortnite configuration file. It is set by default, however, you will not be allowed to make changes to settings in-game while it is set. If it is unset, Fortnite **may** overwrite your custom settings when you update the game.
* You must set the FPS field to `0` in alphares, if you want to have a **Unlimited** framerate in Fortnite.

## To-Do
* Draw an outline on the `Apply` button when focused
* Customize and change the color of the `BS_GROUPBOX` rectangle
* Redraw the radio buttons
